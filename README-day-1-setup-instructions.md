## Software Installation

Please complete the following steps to install the required software for the Developer Bootcamp. You can skip any steps for software you already have installed if there is no stated minimum version, otherwise please ensure your version is equal to or greater than the stated minimum version of the software. If your version is less than the stated minimum version, please upgrade to the latest version as per the instructions below.

## MetaMask

1. Download and install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), a browser extension that you’ll use as a wallet for interacting with your smart contracts and the Ethereum network. MetaMask requires either [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com.au/intl/en_au/chrome/) or [Brave browser](https://brave.com/), and also has limited support for Firefox and Opera. We recommend Chrome or Brave.

2. Open your MetaMask browser extension (look for the fox symbol in your extensions on the top right of the browser), and [setup your account.](https://youtu.be/4ZgFijd02Jo)

3. Once your account is setup, change the Ethereum network that MetaMask is connected to, to the Goerli Testnet by selecting the dropdown at the top, and changing it to Goerli Test Network’

## Funding Your MetaMask Account

Note: For participants who already have and use MetaMask, we strongly suggest not using any accounts that have any funds on Mainnet. In the event of you accidentally checking in code that contains your private key to a public repository, someone can use that to steal your mainnet funds. For the bootcamp, use a [clean freshly generated address](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289452-How-to-Create-an-Additional-Account-in-your-MetaMask-Wallet) that has never been used before on Mainnet.

**You will need to complete these steps for the Goerli test network.**

1. Open MetaMask, make sure the top network is selected as Goerli, move the cursor over your account name, and click on it to copy the wallet address to the clipboard

2. Head to [https://faucets.chain.link/](https://faucets.chain.link/) change the network to GOERLI TEST NETWORK paste in your wallet address and press the ‘Send request’ button. The faucet will send you some Goerli Testnet ETH and LINK, which should show up in your MetaMask wallet a few seconds after in the Assets section.

3. Look to see if you have the LINK token added to the ‘Assets’ section of your MetaMask wallet.

4. If you don’t have the LINK token listed in your Assets (with 0 or more LINK), press the ‘Add Token’ button at the bottom, then enter in the LINK token contract address for the Goerli network [0x326C977E6efc84E512bB9C30f76E30c160eD06FB](https://goerli.etherscan.io/token/0x326C977E6efc84E512bB9C30f76E30c160eD06FB), then press Next, then Add Token.
