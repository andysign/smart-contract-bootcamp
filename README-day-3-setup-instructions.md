## Hardhat Node Preparation

Looking at all the actions done during the third day, everything should be already in place.

1. Just to reiterate, with the Hardhat configuration file set to 'hardhat' or 'local', start your hardhat node:

```sh
yarn hardhat node
```

or

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

2. Open another terminal in order to do other things like run tests or check to see if the blocknumber is configured correctly.

That's it. Nothing else is needed.
